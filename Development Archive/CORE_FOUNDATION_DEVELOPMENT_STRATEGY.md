# üèóÔ∏è PTO Connect Core Foundation Development Strategy

**Strategic Assessment for v1.1.0 - v1.4.0 Development Path**

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive system evaluation, the optimal development path focuses on establishing **4 Core Foundation Systems** that will serve as the backbone for all future modules. This approach minimizes technical debt and prevents the need to revisit/recode foundational elements as we scale.

## üéØ RECOMMENDED DEVELOPMENT SEQUENCE

### Phase 1: Authentication & User Management Core (v1.1.0)
**Priority: CRITICAL - Foundation for Everything**

**Why This First:**
- Every module requires user authentication and role-based access

- Defines user experience patterns that will be consistent throughout

**Core Components to Build:**
1. **Complete Authentication System**
   - Supabase Auth integration with custom user profiles
   - Role-based access control (Admin, Parent, Teacher, Volunteer)
   - Password reset, email verification, profile management
   - Session management and security policies

2. **User Profile Management**
   - Extended user profiles with PTO-specific fields
   - Family/household management (linking parents to children)
   - Contact information and communication preferences
   - Privacy settings and data consent management

3. **Permission & Role System**
   - Granular permission system for different user types
