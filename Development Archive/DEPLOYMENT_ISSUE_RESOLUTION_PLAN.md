# üö® PTO Connect Deployment Issue Resolution Plan

**Created:** June 7, 2025  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Estimated Resolution Time:** 4-8 hours  

---

## üéØ Issue Summary

The PTO Connect system evaluation revealed critical deployment issues preventing frontend access:

1. **Frontend App**: Railway deployment returning 404 errors
2. **Public Site**: SSL certificate mismatch preventing access
3. **Custom Domains**: Not properly configured with SSL certificates

**Backend API Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY OPERATIONAL** on Railway

---

## üîß Step-by-Step Resolution Plan

### **Phase 1: Railway Project Verification (30 minutes)**

#### **Step 1.1: Check Railway Project Status**
1. Log into Railway dashboard at https://railway.app
2. Verify all three projects exist:
   - `pto-connect` (Frontend App)
   - `pto-connect-public` (Public Site)
   - `pto-connect-backend` (API) ‚úÖ Working

#### **Step 1.2: Verify Project Configurations**
For each frontend project, check:
- ‚úÖ GitHub repository connected
- ‚úÖ Build command configured
- ‚úÖ Start command configured
- ‚úÖ Environment variables set

#### **Step 1.3: Check Build Logs**
1. Navigate to each project's deployment logs
2. Look for build failures or errors
3. Document any error messages

---

### **Phase 2: Frontend App Deployment Fix (1-2 hours)**

#### **Step 2.1: Verify Railway Configuration**
Check `pto-connect/railway.json`:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "npm install && npm run build"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "numReplicas": 1,
    "startCommand": "npm run preview",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

#### **Step 2.2: Alternative Configuration (if needed)**
If current config fails, try this alternative:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npx serve dist -s -l 10000"
  }
}
```

#### **Step 2.3: Environment Variables Check**
Ensure these are set in Railway:
```
NODE_ENV=production
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://xvnfynjnxvmcxhfguqmj.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[your_key]
VITE_API_URL=https://api.ptoconnect.com/api
VITE_CLIENT_URL=https://app.ptoconnect.com
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[your_key]
```

#### **Step 2.4: Force Redeploy**
1. In Railway dashboard, click "Deploy" button
2. Monitor build logs for errors
3. Test Railway-generated URL first

---

### **Phase 3: Public Site Deployment Fix (1 hour)**

#### **Step 3.1: Check Docker Configuration**
The public site uses Docker. Verify `pto-connect-public/Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

#### **Step 3.2: Alternative: Switch to Nixpacks**
If Docker fails, create this `railway.json`:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "npm install && npm run build"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npx serve dist -s -l 10000"
  }
}
```

#### **Step 3.3: Environment Variables**
Set these for public site:
```
NODE_ENV=production
VITE_API_URL=https://api.ptoconnect.com/api
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[your_key]
```

---

### **Phase 4: Custom Domain & SSL Configuration (1-2 hours)**

#### **Step 4.1: Verify DNS Configuration**
Check your DNS provider for these records:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: app
Value: [Railway CNAME for frontend project]

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: [Railway CNAME for public site project]

Type: CNAME
Name: api
Value: [Railway CNAME for backend project] ‚úÖ Working
```

#### **Step 4.2: Railway Domain Configuration**
For each project in Railway:
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Domains
2. Add custom domain:
   - Frontend: `app.ptoconnect.com`
   - Public: `www.ptoconnect.com`
   - Backend: `api.ptoconnect.com` ‚úÖ Working
3. Wait for SSL certificate provisioning (10-15 minutes)

#### **Step 4.3: Force SSL Certificate Regeneration**
If certificates don't provision:
1. Remove custom domain
2. Wait 5 minutes
3. Re-add custom domain
4. Monitor SSL status

---

### **Phase 5: Testing & Verification (1 hour)**

#### **Step 5.1: Test Railway URLs**
Before custom domains, test Railway-generated URLs:
- Frontend: `https://[project-name].up.railway.app`
- Public: `https://[project-name].up.railway.app`

#### **Step 5.2: Test Custom Domains**
Once SSL is provisioned:
- Frontend: `https://app.ptoconnect.com`
- Public: `https://www.ptoconnect.com`
- Backend: `https://api.ptoconnect.com` ‚úÖ Working

#### **Step 5.3: Functional Testing**
1. Test login page loads
2. Test API connectivity
3. Test basic navigation
4. Verify no console errors

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Guide

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Issue: Build Fails**
**Symptoms:** Build logs show npm install or build errors
**Solutions:**
1. Check `package.json` for missing dependencies
2. Verify Node.js version compatibility
3. Clear build cache and retry

#### **Issue: 404 on Railway URL**
**Symptoms:** Railway URL shows "Not Found" page
**Solutions:**
1. Check start command in `railway.json`
2. Verify build output directory (`dist`)
3. Try alternative start command: `npx serve dist -s -l 10000`

#### **Issue: SSL Certificate Not Provisioning**
**Symptoms:** Custom domain shows certificate errors
**Solutions:**
1. Verify DNS CNAME records are correct
2. Wait up to 24 hours for DNS propagation
3. Remove and re-add domain in Railway
4. Contact Railway support if persistent

#### **Issue: Environment Variables Not Loading**
**Symptoms:** App loads but features don't work
**Solutions:**
1. Verify all environment variables are set in Railway
2. Check variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Redeploy after adding variables
