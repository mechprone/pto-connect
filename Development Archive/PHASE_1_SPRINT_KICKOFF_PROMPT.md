# ðŸš€ Phase 1 Sprint Kickoff Prompt

**Use this prompt to start Phase 1 implementation in a new AI chat session**

---

## INITIAL PROMPT FOR NEW CHAT SESSION

```
I need you to act as a senior-level, forward-thinking web application engineer and designer to help implement Phase 1 of PTO Connect's multi-tenant authentication and user management system. 

**IMPORTANT**: Please read and reference the attached PTO_CONNECT_SYSTEM_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md file which contains comprehensive background information about the platform, technical architecture, business model, and development approach. This knowledge base should inform all your responses and recommendations.

## IMMEDIATE TASK: Phase 1 Pre-Implementation Analysis & Sprint Planning

Before beginning Phase 1 implementation (Authentication & User Management Core v1.1.0), I need you to:

### 1. SYSTEM AUDIT & CLEANUP
Perform a comprehensive analysis of our current system to ensure it's clean and ready for Phase 1:

**Database Schema Analysis:**
- Examine all existing database tables, columns, and relationships
- Identify any legacy `pto_id` references that should be `org_id` (we standardized on org_id)
- Check for migration artifacts from our recent Vercel/Render â†’ Railway migration
- Validate Row Level Security (RLS) policies are properly implemented
- Assess current schema against the planned multi-tenant architecture

**Codebase Consistency Review:**
- Scan frontend (pto-connect) for inconsistent references
- Scan backend (pto-connect-backend) for inconsistent references  
- Scan public site (pto-connect-public) for any relevant references
- Identify any hardcoded values that need to be configurable
- Check for proper error handling and validation patterns

**API Endpoint Audit:**
- Review existing API endpoints for consistency
- Identify endpoints that need organizational context
- Check authentication and authorization implementations
- Validate request/response patterns

### 2. PHASE 1 SPRINT PLANNING
Based on the system audit, create a detailed implementation plan for Phase 1:

**Sprint 1-2: Core Multi-Tenant Foundation (Weeks 1-4)**
- Database schema implementation for multi-tenant architecture
- Authentication system with organizational context
- Basic user profile management with organizational scope
- Row Level Security policy implementation

**Sprint 3-4: Role-Based Access Control (Weeks 5-8)**  
- Granular permission system across organizational boundaries
- Role management interface for administrators
- Protected routes and API middleware
- Cross-organization family relationship handling

**Sprint 5-6: Advanced Features & Polish (Weeks 9-12)**
- Template sharing system with organizational scope
- Organization switcher for multi-PTO users
- Advanced user management features
- Testing, optimization, and deployment

### 3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
For each sprint, provide:
- Detailed database schema changes (SQL)
- API endpoint specifications
- Frontend component architecture
- Security implementation details
- Testing strategy
- Step-by-step implementation instructions

### 4. MIGRATION STRATEGY
Create a plan for:
- Migrating existing single-tenant data to multi-tenant structure
- Handling existing users and their data
- Ensuring zero downtime during migration
- Rollback procedures if needed

## DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT

**Working Directory:** C:\Dev
**Current System Status:** Production stable on Railway, recently migrated from Vercel/Render
**Development Environment:** VS Code with Cline (Claude Sonnet 3.5)
**My Experience Level:** Non-technical founder - provide step-by-step instructions for all tasks

**Key Requirements:**
- Maintain production stability throughout implementation
- Ensure complete data isolation between organizations (PTOs)
- Design for scalability from single PTO to enterprise district level
- Follow industry best practices for security and performance
- Create user-friendly interfaces for varying technical comfort levels

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Clean, consistent codebase before starting new development
- Comprehensive testing at each step
- Proper documentation for all changes
- Seamless user experience during transition
- Enterprise-ready architecture for future district sales

Please begin with the system audit and provide a comprehensive analysis of our current state, followed by detailed Phase 1 implementation planning.
