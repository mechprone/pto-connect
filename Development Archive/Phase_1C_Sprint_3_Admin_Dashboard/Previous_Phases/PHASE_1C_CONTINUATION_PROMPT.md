**Use this prompt to seamlessly continue PTO Connect development in a new chat session**

---

## üìã CONTEXT SUMMARY

I need you to act as a senior-level, forward-thinking web application engineer and designer to continue implementing Phase 1C of PTO Connect's multi-tenant authentication and user management system.

**IMPORTANT**: Please read and reference the attached PTO_CONNECT_SYSTEM_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md file which contains comprehensive background information about the platform, technical architecture, business model, and development approach.

## üéØ CURRENT PROJECT STATUS

### ‚úÖ **PHASE 1A & 1B COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

**Phase 1A: Database Migration (COMPLETE)**
- ‚úÖ Migrated single PTO (Sunset Elementary PTO) to organizations table
- ‚úÖ Linked all 8 user profiles to organization (f31c6ca8-c199-4fe5-a7bb-81840982d4d3)
- ‚úÖ Synced all emails from auth.users to profiles table
- ‚úÖ Updated foreign key constraints (profiles.org_id ‚Üí organizations.id)
- ‚úÖ Complete data integrity verification passed

**Phase 1B: RLS Policy Standardization (COMPLETE)**
- ‚úÖ Removed 8 legacy/duplicate RLS policies across organizations and events tables
- ‚úÖ Standardized all policies to use `get_user_org_id()` function
- ‚úÖ Implemented role-based access control with `user_has_min_role()`
- ‚úÖ Optimized performance (replaced complex subqueries with function calls)
- ‚úÖ Final audit: Clean policy structure across all tables

### üìä **CURRENT DATABASE STATE**
- **Organizations**: 1 (Sunset Elementary PTO with signup code SUNSET2024)
- **Profiles**: 8 users (all linked to organization with synced emails)
- **RLS Policies**: Clean, standardized, performance-optimized
- **Security**: Complete organizational data isolation implemented
- **Function**: `get_user_org_id()` properly defined and production-ready

   - Add admin-only interface elements
   - Create role management dashboard for admins

2. **API Endpoint Updates**
   - Update all API endpoints to use organizational context
   - Implement role-based API access controls
   - Add organization validation middleware

#### **Sprint 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)**
1. **Organization Switcher** (for future multi-org users)
   - Design and implement organization selection interface
   - Add organization switching functionality
   - Handle session context updates

2. **User Onboarding Enhancement**
   - Create organization-aware onboarding flow
   - Add role assignment during signup
   - Implement invitation system improvements

## üîß TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### **Frontend Updates Needed (pto-connect)**
- **Authentication Context**: Update to include organizational context
- **Role-Based Rendering**: Implement conditional UI based on user roles
- **Profile Management**: Enhanced user profile interface
- **Organization Display**: Show current organization information
- **Admin Dashboard**: Role management interface for administrators

### **Backend Updates Needed (pto-connect-backend)**
- **Middleware**: Add organizational context validation
- **API Endpoints**: Update all endpoints to use `get_user_org_id()`
- **Role Validation**: Implement `user_has_min_role()` checks
- **Session Management**: Include org_id in session context
- **Error Handling**: Organizational context error responses

### **Database Functions to Leverage**
- **`get_user_org_id()`**: Returns user's organization ID
- **`user_has_min_role(role)`**: Validates user role permissions
- **RLS Policies**: Automatically enforce organizational data isolation

## üìÅ CURRENT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### **Repository Structure**
```
C:\Dev\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pto-connect/                 # Frontend (React 18, Vite 5, Tailwind CSS)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pto-connect-backend/         # Backend (Node.js 20, Express.js)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pto-connect-public/          # Public site
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ *.md files                   # Documentation and planning
```

### **Deployment Status**
- **Frontend**: https://app.ptoconnect.com (Railway - Production Stable)
- **Backend**: https://api.ptoconnect.com (Railway - Production Stable)
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with clean RLS policies
- **Version**: v1.0.0 (ready for v1.1.0 Phase 1C features)

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### **Step 1: Frontend Authentication Context Analysis**
Analyze the current authentication context in the React frontend to understand how user sessions are managed and where organizational context needs to be added.

### **Step 2: Backend API Endpoint Audit**
Review existing API endpoints to identify which ones need organizational context validation and role-based access controls.

### **Step 3: Implementation Planning**
Create detailed implementation plan for Phase 1C with specific file changes, component updates, and API modifications needed.

### **Step 4: Progressive Implementation**
Implement changes incrementally with testing at each step to maintain production stability.
