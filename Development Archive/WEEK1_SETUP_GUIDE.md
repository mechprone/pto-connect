### üß™ Task 4: Test User Authentication Flow

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è NEXT PRIORITY - Test live application functionality

**Test on Live URLs:**
- **Frontend**: https://app.ptoconnect.com
- **Backend API**: https://api.ptoconnect.com

**Test Scenarios:**

2. Test user joining existing organization
3. Verify role assignment and permissions

#### 4.3 Authentication Testing
1. Test login/logout functionality
2. Verify protected routes work correctly
3. Test role-based access control

**Local Testing (backup):**
```bash
# If needed for debugging
http://localhost:3001/onboarding/create-pto
```

### üè¢ Task 5: Multi-Tenant Data Isolation Verification

**Status**: Ready after database setup

**Verification Steps:**

#### 5.1 Create Test Organizations
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor after main setup
INSERT INTO organizations (name, slug, signup_code, subscription_status, trial_ends_at, settings)
VALUES 
  ('Lincoln Elementary PTO', 'lincoln-elementary', 'LINCOLN123', 'trial', now() + interval '14 days', '{"school_name": "Lincoln Elementary"}'),
  ('Washington Middle PTO', 'washington-middle', 'WASH456', 'trial', now() + interval '14 days', '{"school_name": "Washington Middle School"}');
```

#### 5.2 Test Data Isolation
1. Create users in different organizations
2. Create events, transactions, etc. in each org
3. Verify users can only see their organization's data
4. Test RLS policies are working correctly
