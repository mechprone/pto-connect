C:\Dev has three github repos in it that combine to form a large web app that I'm currently building. c:\Dev\pto-connect contians the heart of the app and is associated with app.ptoconnect.com. c:\Dev\pto-connect-backend contains the backend of the app and is associated with api.ptoconnect.com. Lastly c:\Dev\pto-connect-public contains the public facing website that is more for sales and marketing but also onboarding new PTOs. "C:\Dev\PTO_Connect_Complete_MVP.pdf" contains the MVP for the app and lays out it's functionality. Act a professional web developer and software engineer that also specializes in professional, modern, well designed UI/UX arrangements to help complete this site. Look at the current code and identify any possible issues that need to be corrected before moving forward and continuing to build. The app needs to be created with scalability and stability in mind as it will eventually be rolled out to PTOs all across the United States using a subscription model. Ask me questions throughout the process on design and functionality choice to ensure we can build it as I intend from the start and not have to spend as much time tweaking things after the fact.
