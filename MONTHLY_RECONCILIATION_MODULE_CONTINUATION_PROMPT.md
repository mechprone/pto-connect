# üöÄ Monthly Reconciliation Module - Phase 2 Implementation

## Context
I just completed the initial scaffolding for the Monthly Budget Reconciliation Module as part of the Budget Module Advanced Enhancement (v1.8.0). The foundation has been laid with database schema, backend API endpoints, and frontend React components. However, there's a critical issue that needs immediate attention before proceeding.

## Current Situation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ISSUE: Git Repository Sync Problem
The frontend changes are currently on a feature branch (`feat/reconciliation-module`) while the backend changes are on the main branch. There's a git synchronization issue preventing the frontend from being merged to main.

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. First, check the current git status of the `pto-connect` repository
2. Investigate why the local main branch is out of sync with the remote
3. Resolve the "bad object refs/remotes/origin/main" error
4. Merge the `feat/reconciliation-module` branch into main
5. Ensure both repositories are properly synchronized

### What Was Completed
- ‚úÖ Database schema with 4 tables for reconciliation workflow
- ‚úÖ 7 RESTful API endpoints in the backend
- ‚úÖ 5 React components for the reconciliation UI
- ‚úÖ Integration with existing budget module
- ‚úÖ Both development servers running (backend: 3000, frontend: 5173)

### What Needs to Be Done Next

**Phase 1: Repository Synchronization (URGENT)**
```bash
# Commands to investigate and fix:
cd pto-connect
git status
git branch -a
git remote -v
git fetch --all
# Then determine the best approach to sync
```

**Phase 2: Core Functionality Implementation**
1. **OCR Integration**
   - Research and select OCR service (Tesseract, Google Vision API, or AWS Textract)
   - Implement PDF/image upload and processing
   - Create parser for bank statement formats
   - Add validation and error handling

2. **Smart Matching Algorithm**
   - Implement fuzzy string matching for transaction descriptions
   - Add amount matching with configurable tolerance (e.g., ¬±$0.50)
   - Create machine learning model for pattern recognition
   - Build confidence scoring system

3. **Discrepancy Management**
   - Design UI for reviewing unmatched transactions
   - Add manual matching capabilities
   - Create audit trail for all actions
   - Implement approval workflow for discrepancies

4. **Report Generation**
   - Build comprehensive reconciliation report template
   - Add PDF export using jsPDF or similar
   - Create Excel export functionality
   - Design summary dashboard with charts

## Technical Requirements
- **OCR Library**: Tesseract.js for client-side or Google Vision API for server-side
- **Matching Algorithm**: Levenshtein distance for fuzzy matching
- **PDF Generation**: jsPDF with custom templates
- **Excel Export**: xlsx library for Node.js

- `MONTHLY_RECONCILIATION_MODULE_INITIAL_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - What was just completed
- `PTO_CONNECT_SYSTEM_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` - System architecture and guidelines
- `pto-connect-backend/database/migrations/reconciliation_schema.sql` - Database schema
- `pto-connect-backend/routes/budget/reconciliation.js` - API endpoints

## Development Approach
Please start by resolving the Git synchronization issue, then proceed with implementing the OCR functionality. Focus on getting a working prototype that can:
1. Upload a bank statement (PDF or image)
2. Extract transaction data using OCR
3. Display extracted transactions for review
4. Allow manual corrections before proceeding to matching

Remember to follow PTO Connect's established patterns and maintain the high code quality standards outlined in the knowledge base.
