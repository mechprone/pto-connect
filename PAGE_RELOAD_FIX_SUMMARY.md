# Page Reload Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The PTO Connect application was experiencing abnormal page reloads and component unmounting when users switched browser windows/tabs and returned. This was causing loss of user work and poor user experience.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. React.StrictMode in Production
**Problem**: React.StrictMode was enabled in production builds, causing intentional double-rendering and component unmounting for development debugging.

**Fix**: Modified `src/main.jsx` to conditionally enable StrictMode only in development:
```javascript
const isDevelopment = import.meta.env.DEV;

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  isDevelopment ? (
    <React.StrictMode>
      {AppWithRouter}
    </React.StrictMode>
  ) : (
    AppWithRouter
  )
);
```

### 2. Aggressive Visibility Change Handlers
**Problem**: Multiple visibility change listeners were triggering on every window focus change, causing unnecessary operations.

**Fix**: 
- Added throttling to only act if 30+ seconds have passed since last activity
- Added singleton pattern to prevent multiple listeners
- Updated `eventsStore.js` and `globalCache.js`

### 3. Excessive Auth State Triggers
**Problem**: `useUserProfile` hook was triggering on every `INITIAL_SESSION` event, causing unnecessary re-fetches.

**Fix**: Modified auth state handler to ignore non-actionable events like `INITIAL_SESSION` and `TOKEN_REFRESHED`.

### 4. Component Re-render Optimization
**Problem**: Calendar component was re-rendering excessively due to non-memoized functions and objects.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive memoization with `useCallback` and `useMemo` for:
- Event handlers
- Calendar plugins array
- Header toolbar configuration
- Event content renderer

## Files Modified

1. **`src/main.jsx`** - Conditional StrictMode
2. **`src/utils/eventsStore.js`** - Throttled visibility handlers, singleton pattern
3. **`src/utils/globalCache.js`** - Throttled visibility handlers, singleton pattern  
4. **`src/modules/hooks/useUserProfile.js`** - Optimized auth state handling
5. **`src/modules/calendar/CalendarPage.jsx`** - Component optimization with memoization

## Additional Debugging Added

- Component lifecycle tracking with mount/unmount timing
- Render count tracking to identify excessive re-renders
- Warning system for abnormally quick component unmounts (< 1 second)
- Enhanced logging for troubleshooting

## Expected Results

After these fixes, users should experience:

1. **No more page reloads** when switching windows/tabs
2. **Preserved form data** and user progress
3. **Faster page performance** due to reduced re-renders
4. **Stable component behavior** with proper lifecycle management

## Testing Instructions

### Test the Fix
1. Navigate to any page in the application (especially `/calendar`)
2. Fill out a form or interact with the page
3. Switch to another application/window for 10+ seconds
4. Return to the PTO Connect browser tab
5. **Expected**: Page should remain in the same state with no reload

### Monitor Console Logs
Look for these improved log patterns:
- Fewer "Component unmounting" messages
- No rapid mount/unmount cycles
- Reduced "Auth state change" frequency
- Visibility change logs only appearing after 30+ second intervals

### Performance Verification
- Page should feel more responsive
- Calendar should load faster
- No visible "flashing" or reloading when returning to the tab

## If Issues Persist

If the problem continues, check for:

1. **Browser-specific issues**: Test in different browsers
2. **Memory pressure**: Monitor browser memory usage
3. **Network disconnection**: Check if network issues trigger reloads
4. **Railway hosting**: Verify Railway isn't causing connection drops
5. **Additional React issues**: Check for key prop issues in list rendering

## Rollback Plan

If these changes cause new issues, the changes can be easily reverted:
- Restore StrictMode by removing the conditional logic
- Remove the throttling from visibility handlers
- Remove the memoization from CalendarPage

All changes are backward compatible and don't affect the core application logic.
