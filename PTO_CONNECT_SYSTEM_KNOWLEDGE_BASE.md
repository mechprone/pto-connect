## üìä DATABASE ARCHITECTURE

### Current Database Status
- **Platform**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented
- **Schema**: Multi-tenant architecture with organizational hierarchy
- **Migration Status**: Recently migrated from Vercel/Render to Railway

### Key Database Tables
```sql
-- Core organizational hierarchy
districts (id, name, code, settings, subscription_tier)
schools (id, district_id, name, code, grade_levels)
organizations (id, school_id, name, type, subdomain, branding)

-- User management
user_profiles (id, user_id, organization_id, first_name, last_name, children)
user_roles (id, user_id, organization_id, role_type, permissions, scope)

-- Template sharing system
template_library (id, created_by_organization_id, sharing_level, content)

-- Cross-organization relationships
family_relationships (id, primary_user_id, related_user_id, organization_id)
```

### Data Consistency Issues
- **Legacy References**: Some lingering `pto_id` references need cleanup (should be `org_id`)
- **Migration Artifacts**: Potential inconsistencies from platform migrations
- **Schema Validation**: Need comprehensive audit before Phase 1 implementation

- **Deployment Safety**: Use feature flags and gradual rollouts
- **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and error tracking

## üßπ AUTOMATED CLEANUP STRATEGY

### Post-Phase Cleanup Protocol
After completing each major phase or sprint, AI assistants should automatically:

1. **Identify Legacy Files**: Review C:\Dev directory for completed phase documentation
2. **Archive Systematically**: Move legacy files to Development Archive/ folder
3. **Remove Duplicates**: Eliminate duplicate config files and accidentally created folders
4. **Preserve History**: Ensure all legacy work is safely archived, never deleted
5. **Maintain Clean Workspace**: Keep only current phase files visible in root directory

### Cleanup Benefits
- **Improved Focus**: Only current development files visible
- **Reduced Confusion**: No mixing of legacy and current documentation
- **Better Performance**: Faster file operations with fewer root directory items
- **Preserved History**: Complete development audit trail maintained in archive
- **Professional Organization**: Clean, efficient development environment

### Implementation
- **Trigger**: Automatic cleanup after each major phase completion
- **Method**: Batch script or manual file operations to move legacy content
- **Archive Location**: C:\Dev\Development Archive\ (organized by completion date)
- **Safety**: Never delete files, only move to archive for future reference

This knowledge base should be referenced in all development conversations to ensure consistency and context awareness across different AI interactions and development sessions.
