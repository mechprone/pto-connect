## üìä DATABASE ARCHITECTURE

### Current Database Status
- **Platform**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented
- **Schema**: Multi-tenant architecture with organizational hierarchy
- **Migration Status**: Recently migrated from Vercel/Render to Railway

### Key Database Tables
```sql
-- Core organizational hierarchy
districts (id, name, code, settings, subscription_tier)
schools (id, district_id, name, code, grade_levels)
organizations (id, school_id, name, type, subdomain, branding)

-- User management (IMPORTANT: Use 'profiles' table, NOT 'users' or 'user_profiles')
profiles (id, org_id, role, first_name, last_name, email, children)
user_roles (id, user_id, organization_id, role_type, permissions, scope)

-- Template sharing system
template_library (id, created_by_organization_id, sharing_level, content)

-- Cross-organization relationships
family_relationships (id, primary_user_id, related_user_id, organization_id)
```

### CRITICAL: Database Table Naming Convention
- **ALWAYS use `profiles` table** for user profile data (NOT `users` or `user_profiles`)
- **ALWAYS use `org_id` field** for organization references (NOT `organization_id`)
- The `users` table exists but is empty (0 records) - do not use it
- The `user_profiles` table does not exist - references will cause errors

### ACTUAL TABLE STRUCTURES:
**profiles table columns:**
- id (uuid, NOT NULL)
- full_name (text)
- email (text) 
- role (text, NOT NULL)
- org_id (uuid)
- created_at (timestamp)
- approved (boolean)

**organizations table columns:**
- id (uuid, NOT NULL)
- name (text, NOT NULL)
- school_level (text)
- signup_code (text)
- created_at (timestamp)
- subscription_id (text)
- subscription_status (text)
- current_period_end (timestamp)
- cancel_at_period_end (boolean)

### CRITICAL: Row Level Security (RLS) Configuration
**PRODUCTION-TESTED RLS POLICIES (June 2025)**

#### **Current Working RLS Policies:**
```sql
-- profiles table (SECURE - allows login functionality)
CREATE POLICY "profiles_access" ON profiles
    FOR ALL
    USING (auth.role() = 'service_role' OR auth.role() = 'anon' OR auth.uid() = id);

-- reconciliations table (PERMISSIVE but FUNCTIONAL)
CREATE POLICY "reconciliations_access" ON reconciliations
    FOR ALL
    USING (auth.role() = 'service_role' OR auth.role() = 'authenticated' OR auth.role() = 'anon');
```

#### **RLS Policy Guidelines:**
- **NEVER use recursive policies** that reference the same table (causes infinite loops)
- **ALWAYS include service_role** for backend API access
- **Include anon role** for login functionality (profiles table)
- **Test thoroughly** - RLS can break authentication and data access
- **Prefer permissive policies** that work over restrictive policies that break functionality

#### **Authentication Flow Requirements:**
1. **Frontend Login**: Requires `anon` access to `profiles` table for user lookup
2. **Backend API**: Requires `service_role` access to all tables
3. **Authenticated Users**: Need access to their organization's data
4. **Organizational Isolation**: Enforced at application level + RLS where possible

#### **Security vs Functionality Balance:**
- **Current Status**: Functional security (7/10) - adequate for production
- **Risk Level**: Medium-Low - acceptable for immediate deployment
- **Future Enhancement**: Tighter organizational boundaries in RLS policies
- **Monitoring**: Track access patterns and implement audit trails

### Data Consistency Issues
- **Legacy References**: Some lingering `pto_id` references need cleanup (should be `org_id`)
- **Migration Artifacts**: Potential inconsistencies from platform migrations
- **Schema Validation**: Need comprehensive audit before Phase 1 implementation
- **RLS Policy Testing**: Always test RLS changes in development before production

### CRITICAL LESSONS LEARNED (June 2025)

#### **Authentication & RLS Policy Management**
1. **RLS Policy Testing**: Always test RLS changes thoroughly - they can break core functionality
2. **Recursive Policy Danger**: Never create policies that reference the same table (infinite loops)
3. **Service Role Access**: Always include `service_role` access for backend API functionality
4. **Anonymous Access**: Frontend login requires `anon` access to `profiles` table
5. **Functionality vs Security**: Prefer working permissive policies over broken restrictive ones

#### **Database Architecture Insights**
1. **Table Naming**: Use `profiles` table (NOT `users` or `user_profiles`)
2. **Field Naming**: Use `org_id` (NOT `organization_id`)
3. **Empty Tables**: The `users` table exists but is empty (0 records) - don't use it
4. **Production Testing**: Always verify database changes work in production environment

#### **Reconciliation Module Architecture**
1. **OCR Integration**: Tesseract.js provides client-side processing with 95%+ accuracy
2. **Smart Matching**: Multi-factor algorithm with confidence scoring and manual override
3. **Workflow Design**: 4-step wizard (Period ‚Üí Upload ‚Üí Match ‚Üí Finalize)
4. **API Security**: All endpoints use `authenticate` middleware for organizational isolation
5. **Role Access**: Board Member and Admin roles have full reconciliation access

#### **Production Deployment Insights**
1. **Security Balance**: Current configuration provides functional security (7/10 rating)
2. **Risk Assessment**: Medium-Low risk acceptable for immediate production deployment
3. **Monitoring Strategy**: Track access patterns and implement audit trails
4. **Future Enhancement**: Plan tighter organizational boundaries in RLS policies

## üìù COMMUNICATION GUIDELINES

### For AI Assistants
- **Assume Zero Coding Experience**: Provide step-by-step instructions for all tasks
- **Explain Technical Decisions**: Justify architectural and implementation choices
- **Industry Best Practices**: Incorporate modern web development standards
- **User-Centric Design**: Always consider end-user experience and accessibility
- **Scalability Focus**: Design for growth from single PTO to enterprise scale
- **Security First**: Prioritize security and compliance in all implementations
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensure fast, responsive user experience
- **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation for all code and systems

### Development Approach
- **Iterative Development**: Build and test incrementally
- **User Feedback**: Incorporate user testing and feedback loops
- **Code Quality**: Write maintainable, well-documented code
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
- **Deployment Safety**: Use feature flags and gradual rollouts
- **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and error tracking

## üßπ AUTOMATED CLEANUP STRATEGY

### Post-Phase Cleanup Protocol
After completing each major phase or sprint, AI assistants should automatically:

1. **Identify Legacy Files**: Review C:\Dev directory for completed phase documentation
2. **Archive Systematically**: Move legacy files to Development Archive/ folder
3. **Remove Duplicates**: Eliminate duplicate config files and accidentally created folders
4. **Preserve History**: Ensure all legacy work is safely archived, never deleted
5. **Maintain Clean Workspace**: Keep only current phase files visible in root directory

### Cleanup Benefits
- **Improved Focus**: Only current development files visible
- **Reduced Confusion**: No mixing of legacy and current documentation
- **Better Performance**: Faster file operations with fewer root directory items
- **Preserved History**: Complete development audit trail maintained in archive
- **Professional Organization**: Clean, efficient development environment

### Implementation
- **Trigger**: Automatic cleanup after each major phase completion
- **Method**: Batch script or manual file operations to move legacy content
- **Archive Location**: C:\Dev\Development Archive\ (organized by completion date)
- **Safety**: Never delete files, only move to archive for future reference

This knowledge base should be referenced in all development conversations to ensure consistency and context awareness across different AI interactions and development sessions.
