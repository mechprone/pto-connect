# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The error "Function Runtimes must have a valid version" was caused by an invalid `functions` configuration in vercel.json. This was unrelated to the React JSX runtime issue.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed vercel.json
- Removed the invalid `functions` configuration
- Simplified to essential settings only
- Now uses standard `npm run build` command

### 2. Current vercel.json:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite",
  "installCommand": "npm install --legacy-peer-deps",
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Build Process
The build will now:
1. Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
2. Execute `npm run build` which:
   - Runs the prebuild script (ensures jsx-runtime files exist)
   - Runs `vite build`

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push the updated vercel.json
2. The deployment should now proceed past the configuration error
3. If you encounter the JSX runtime error again, update vercel.json to use:
   ```json
   "buildCommand": "npm run build:vercel"
   ```
   This will use the custom build script with additional debugging.

## Testing Locally
Before pushing, you can test the build locally:
```bash
cd pto-connect
npm run test:build
```

The configuration error should now be resolved, allowing Vercel to proceed with the actual build process.
