#### **‚úÖ Smart Transaction Matching (COMPLETE)**
- **AI-Powered Algorithm**: Multi-factor scoring system with confidence levels
- **Intelligent Weighting**: Amount (40%), Description (30%), Date (20%), Vendor (10%)
- **Fuzzy String Matching**: Levenshtein distance for description comparison
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Auto-match at 85%+, suggest at 60%+, manual review below
- **Manual Override**: Complete user control for edge cases and corrections

#### **‚úÖ Enhanced User Experience (COMPLETE)**
- **4-Step Wizard**: Period Selection ‚Üí OCR Upload ‚Üí Smart Matching ‚Üí Finalization

- **Interactive Review**: Edit, validate, and remove extracted transactions
- **Visual Confidence**: Color-coded confidence levels and progress indicators
- **Professional Reports**: Comprehensive reconciliation documentation

### **Dashboard Navigation Fix - COMPLETE**
Resolved critical user experience issues where dashboard buttons were navigating to non-existent routes, causing blank pages.

#### **‚úÖ Budget Dashboard AI Buttons (FIXED)**
**Problem**: All three budget creation buttons (Manual Entry, Stella Assisted, Stella Auto-Generate) were going to the same manual budget entry page.

**Solution**: Each button now provides distinct experiences:
- **Manual Entry** ‚Üí `/budget/create` (Basic budget form)
- **Stella Assisted** ‚Üí `/communications/ai?context=budget&mode=assisted` (AI Content Assistant)
- **Stella Auto-Generate** ‚Üí `/ai-workflow-orchestrator?context=budget&mode=automated` (AI Workflow Orchestrator)

#### **‚úÖ Communications Dashboard (FIXED)**
All communication buttons now use existing routes instead of non-existent ones:
- Email creation ‚Üí `/communications/email`
- Social media ‚Üí `/communications/social`
- SMS ‚Üí `/communications/sms`
- Newsletter ‚Üí `/communications/create?type=newsletter`
- AI Assistant ‚Üí `/communications/ai`

#### **‚úÖ Route Mapping Analysis (COMPLETE)**
- Comprehensive audit of App.jsx routes vs dashboard button destinations
- Fixed all onClick handlers to use existing routes with appropriate parameters
- Eliminated all "blank page" navigation issues across all dashboards

## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Reconciliation Architecture**
```
Reconciliation Workflow:
1. Period Selection ‚Üí Month/Year picker with validation
2. OCR Upload ‚Üí Tesseract.js processing with progress tracking
3. Smart Matching ‚Üí AI algorithm with confidence scoring
4. Finalization ‚Üí Report generation and data persistence
```

### **Database Schema**
```sql
-- Reconciliation tables with proper foreign keys
reconciliations (id, org_id, period_month, period_year, status, created_at)
reconciliation_transactions (id, reconciliation_id, amount, description, date, confidence_score)
reconciliation_matches (id, reconciliation_id, bank_transaction_id, expense_id, match_type)
```

### **API Endpoints**
- `POST /api/reconciliation/start` - Initialize reconciliation period
- `POST /api/reconciliation/upload` - Process OCR bank statement
- `POST /api/reconciliation/match` - Execute smart matching algorithm
- `POST /api/reconciliation/finalize` - Complete reconciliation process
- `GET /api/reconciliation/history` - Retrieve reconciliation history

### **Security & Access Control**
- **RLS Policies**: Organizational data isolation with production-tested policies
- **Role-Based Access**: Board Member and Admin roles have full reconciliation access
- **API Security**: All endpoints use `authenticate` middleware for organizational context
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and error handling
