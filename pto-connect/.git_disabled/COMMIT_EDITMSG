ðŸ”§ FIX: Vercel deployment configuration

âœ… Fixed Vercel Build Issues:
- Added explicit buildCommand: 'npm run build'
- Specified outputDirectory: 'dist'
- Set framework: 'vite'
- Maintained SPA routing with rewrites

ðŸš€ This should resolve the DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND error
ðŸ“¦ Build tested locally and working correctly
