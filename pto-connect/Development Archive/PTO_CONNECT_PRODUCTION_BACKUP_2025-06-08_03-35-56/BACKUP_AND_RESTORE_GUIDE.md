## ðŸš€ Railway Restore Points & Backup Strategy

### Railway Built-in Backup Features

#### 1. **Git-Based Restore Points** âœ…
Railway automatically creates restore points through Git integration:
- **Current Commit Hash**: Latest successful deployment
- **Branch Protection**: Main branch contains stable code
- **Rollback Capability**: Can redeploy any previous commit

#### 2. **Deployment History** âœ…
Railway maintains complete deployment history:
- **Access**: Railway Dashboard â†’ Project â†’ Deployments tab
- **Features**: View all deployments, logs, and status
- **Rollback**: Click "Redeploy" on any previous successful deployment

#### 3. **Environment Variable Snapshots** âœ…
Railway preserves environment variable configurations:
- **Current State**: All Supabase and API variables configured
- **Version Control**: Changes tracked in deployment history
- **Backup**: Variables documented in this backup

### Creating Railway Restore Points

#### Method 1: Git Tags (Recommended)
```bash
# Create a production milestone tag
git tag -a "v1.0-production-stable" -m "Production milestone: All services operational"
git push origin v1.0-production-stable

# For each repository:
cd pto-connect
git tag -a "v1.0-frontend-stable" -m "Frontend production stable"
git push origin v1.0-frontend-stable

cd ../pto-connect-backend  
git tag -a "v1.0-backend-stable" -m "Backend production stable"
git push origin v1.0-backend-stable

cd ../pto-connect-public
git tag -a "v1.0-public-stable" -m "Public site production stable"
git push origin v1.0-public-stable
```

#### Method 2: Railway Project Snapshots
1. **Document Current State**: 
   - Note deployment IDs from Railway dashboard
   - Screenshot environment variables
   - Record domain configurations

2. **Create Milestone Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b production-milestone-2025-06-08
   git push origin production-milestone-2025-06-08
   ```

#### Method 3: Environment Export
```bash
# Export current Railway environment variables
railway variables --json > railway-env-backup.json
```

## ðŸ”„ Restore Procedures

### Quick Restore (Railway Dashboard)
1. Go to Railway Dashboard â†’ Select Project
2. Navigate to **Deployments** tab
3. Find the stable deployment (June 8, 2025)
4. Click **"Redeploy"** to restore to that exact state

### Full System Restore (From Backup)
1. **Restore Source Code**:
   ```bash
   # Copy from backup location
   robocopy "C:\Dev\PTO_CONNECT_PRODUCTION_BACKUP_2025-06-08_03-35-56\pto-connect" "C:\Dev\pto-connect-restored" /E
   robocopy "C:\Dev\PTO_CONNECT_PRODUCTION_BACKUP_2025-06-08_03-35-56\pto-connect-backend" "C:\Dev\pto-connect-backend-restored" /E
   robocopy "C:\Dev\PTO_CONNECT_PRODUCTION_BACKUP_2025-06-08_03-35-56\pto-connect-public" "C:\Dev\pto-connect-public-restored" /E
   ```

2. **Restore Git Repositories**:
   ```bash
   cd pto-connect-restored
   git init
   git remote add origin https://github.com/mechprone/pto-connect.git
   git add .
   git commit -m "Restore from production backup"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Restore Railway Deployments**:
   - Connect restored repositories to Railway
   - Configure environment variables from backup documentation
   - Deploy each service
