# üîç Deployment Monitoring Status Report

**Time:** 2:25 AM CST  
**Status:** ACTIVELY MONITORING REBUILDS  

## Current Situation

### ‚úÖ Backend API
- **Status:** Fully operational
- **URL:** https://api.ptoconnect.com
- **Health Check:** Passing consistently

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Frontend & Public Sites  
- **Status:** Rebuilding with nixpacks
- **Expected:** 502 errors during rebuild (normal)
- **Progress:** Railway processing new configurations

## Changes Applied

### üîß Critical Fixes Implemented
1. **Removed problematic Dockerfiles** - Eliminated build dependency issues
2. **Added nixpacks.toml configurations** - Cleaner, more reliable builds
3. **Fixed build process** - Proper handling of devDependencies
4. **Updated package.json** - Ensured serve dependency availability

### üìã Nixpacks Configuration
```toml
[phases.build]
cmds = ["npm install", "npm run build"]

[phases.start]
cmd = "npx serve dist -s -l $PORT"
```

## Monitoring Progress

- **Check Interval:** Every 20 seconds
- **Max Duration:** 5 minutes total monitoring
- **Current Check:** 5/15 completed
- **Backend Stability:** 100% uptime during monitoring

## Expected Timeline

- **Nixpacks Build Time:** 2-5 minutes typical
- **Total Rebuild:** Should complete within monitoring window
- **Success Indicator:** All three systems returning 200 status

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Monitoring** - Let script complete full cycle
2. **Auto-Success Detection** - Script will generate success report when all systems operational
3. **Fallback Plan** - If monitoring completes without success, additional debugging required

**üéØ Current Status: ON TRACK - Rebuilds in progress as expected**
