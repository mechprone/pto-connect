## üéØ IMMEDIATE TASK: Phase 1C Sprint 2 Implementation

### **PHASE 1C SPRINT 2 OBJECTIVES**
Enhance the API endpoints and build role-based management interfaces to complete the multi-tenant authentication system.

### **PHASE 1C SPRINT 2 DELIVERABLES**

#### **Week 1: API Endpoint Enhancement**
1. **Backend API Updates**
   - Update all existing API endpoints to use organizational context
   - Implement role-based API access controls using `user_has_min_role()`
   - Add organization validation middleware to all protected routes
   - Enhance error handling for organizational context violations

2. **API Security Hardening**
   - Ensure all endpoints respect organizational boundaries
   - Implement comprehensive role validation
   - Add audit logging for administrative actions
   - Test cross-organizational data access prevention

#### **Week 2: Role Management Dashboard**
1. **Admin Interface Development**
   - Create role management dashboard for organization administrators
   - Build user role assignment interface
   - Implement role hierarchy visualization
   - Add bulk user management capabilities

2. **Enhanced User Experience**
   - Develop organization switcher interface (foundation for future multi-org users)
   - Enhance user onboarding with organization-aware flows
   - Implement invitation system improvements
   - Create organization settings management interface

## üîß TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### **Backend Updates Needed (pto-connect-backend)**
- **API Endpoints**: Update all endpoints to use `get_user_org_id()` and organizational context
- **Middleware Enhancement**: Expand organizational context validation across all routes
- **Role Validation**: Implement `user_has_min_role()` checks on administrative endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error responses for organizational context violations
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging for role changes and administrative actions

### **Frontend Updates Needed (pto-connect)**
- **Admin Dashboard**: Role management interface for administrators
- **Organization Management**: Settings and configuration interface
- **User Management**: Enhanced user listing with role-based filtering
- **Organization Switcher**: Interface foundation for future multi-org support
- **Enhanced Onboarding**: Organization-aware signup and invitation flows

### **Database Functions to Leverage**
- **`get_user_org_id()`**: Returns user's organization ID (already implemented)
- **`user_has_min_role(role)`**: Validates user role permissions (already implemented)
- **RLS Policies**: Automatically enforce organizational data isolation (already implemented)

## üìÅ CURRENT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### **Repository Structure**
```
C:\Dev\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pto-connect/                 # Frontend (React 18, Vite 5, Tailwind CSS)

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### **Step 1: Backend API Audit**
Analyze all existing API endpoints in the pto-connect-backend to identify which ones need organizational context validation and role-based access controls.

### **Step 2: Middleware Implementation**
Enhance the existing organizational context middleware to cover all API routes and implement comprehensive role validation.

### **Step 3: Admin Dashboard Development**
Create the role management dashboard interface for organization administrators to manage user roles and permissions.

### **Step 4: Enhanced User Experience**
Implement organization switcher interface and enhanced onboarding flows for better user experience.

## üöÄ READY TO BEGIN

**Phase 1C Sprint 1 has created a solid authentication foundation with organizational context and role-based permissions. Sprint 2 will enhance the API layer and build the management interfaces that leverage this foundation.**

Please begin by analyzing the current backend API structure to create a detailed implementation plan for adding organizational context and role validation to all endpoints. Focus on maintaining production stability while enhancing security and user management capabilities.

**Let's build powerful role-based management features on our solid authentication foundation!**
