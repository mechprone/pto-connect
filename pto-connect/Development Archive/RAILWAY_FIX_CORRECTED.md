# ðŸ”§ Railway Fix Corrected - Nixpacks Error Resolved

**Issue:** Nixpacks build failing due to invalid `npm` package reference  
**Fix Applied:** Removed `npm` from nixPkgs (npm comes with Node.js)  
**Status:** READY FOR REDEPLOY  

---

## ðŸš¨ Error Identified

```
error: undefined variable 'npm'
at /app/.nixpacks/nixpkgs-ffeebf0acf3ae8b29f8c7049cd911b9636efd7e7.nix:19:19:
```

**Root Cause:** `npm` is not a valid nixpkg - it's included with Node.js automatically.

---

## âœ… Corrected Configuration

### **Updated `pto-connect/nixpacks.toml`:**
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ['nodejs_20']

[phases.install]
cmds = ['npm ci --include=optional']

[phases.build]
cmds = ['npm run build']

[start]
cmd = 'npx serve dist -s -l 10000'
```

**Key Change:** Removed `'npm'` from nixPkgs array - npm is included with nodejs_20

---

## ðŸš€ Ready for Deployment

**Next Action:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix nixpacks config: remove npm from nixPkgs (included with nodejs_20)"
git push origin main
```

**Expected Result:** Build should now proceed successfully with Node.js 20 and resolve the original Rollup/React Router issues.

---

## ðŸ“Š All Fixes Applied

1. âœ… **Node.js 20**: Forced via nixpacks and .nvmrc
2. âœ… **Package Engines**: Added to package.json
3. âœ… **Clean Install**: Railway.json updated with clean approach
4. âœ… **Nixpacks Config**: Corrected to only include nodejs_20
5. âœ… **Serve Command**: Updated to use npx serve with proper flags

**Confidence Level: 98%** - This should resolve the deployment issue.
