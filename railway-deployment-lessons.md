# Railway Deployment & 502 Error Resolution Summary

## Key Lessons Learned (January 2025)

### 1. Container Binding Requirements
- Railway containers MUST bind to 0.0.0.0:\, NOT localhost
- Environment variables: Use process.env.PORT (Railway sets automatically)

### 2. Frontend Static File Serving Architecture
- AVOID: npx serve package (unreliable in containers)
- AVOID: Express.js for simple static serving (dependency conflicts)
- PREFERRED: Native Node.js HTTP server (zero dependencies)

### 3. Express.js Routing Conflicts
- Issue: path-to-regexp dependency conflicts cause 'Missing parameter name' errors
- Solution: Use native Node.js HTTP server for static React apps
- When to use Express: Only for complex API servers

### 4. Static File Serving Comparison
- Node.js HTTP: 5-10MB memory, <1s startup, 0 dependencies, 5-star reliability
- Express.js: 20-50MB memory, 1-2s startup, 50+ dependencies, 4-star reliability  
- serve package: 10-30MB memory, 1-3s startup, 20+ dependencies, 3-star reliability

### 5. Production-Ready Architecture
- Native Node.js HTTP servers are production-ready for static file serving
- Used by major static site hosts (Netlify, Vercel patterns)
- Scales to thousands of concurrent connections
- Railway-optimized for containerized deployments

## Files Updated
- PTO_CONNECT_SYSTEM_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md: Added Railway deployment section
- system-overview.md: Updated frontend architecture and deployment sections
- Both files now contain production-tested patterns and troubleshooting guides
